============

Remember those books where the teenage wizards struggle against the Dark Lord
of Evil? That movie where the dwarves fight to recapture their mountain home
from a dragon? That animated TV show about mystical knights and their army of
clones righting wrongs across the galaxy?

Aren’t those awesome?

Here’s your chance to put yourself in the heroes’ shoes in stories like those.

Fate Accelerated Edition is a tabletop roleplaying game, where you and your
friends gather around and tell stories full of danger, excitement, and
adventure. You might have played games similar to this before—Dungeons &
Dragons is a very popular one—but don’t worry if you haven’t; this booklet will
guide you through it.

Here’s what you’ll need to play:

-   Three to five people. One of you will be the gamemaster, the
    others players. We’ll talk about what those mean later.
-   Fate Dice™, at least four, preferably four per person. These are a special
    kind of six-sided dice that are marked on two sides with a plus symbol [+],
    two sides with a minus symbol [-], and two sides are blank [ ]. You can get
    these dice from many hobby and game stores, often under their original
    name—Fudge dice. We call them Fate Dice in this book, but you can call them
    whatever you like. Evil Hat will offer Fate Dice for sale
    at [www.evilhat.com](http://www.evilhat.com/) later in 2013.

* * * * *

If you don't want to use Fudge dice, you don't have to–any set of regular
six-sided dice will work. If you're using regular dice, you read 5 or 6 as [+],
1 or 2 as [-], and 3 or 4 as [ ].\

* * * * *

The Deck of Fate is an alternative to Fate Dice. It’s a deck of cards that
mimics the probability of Fate Dice, and it’s designed to be used in the same
way Fate Dice are. The Deck of Fate will be available from Evil Hat in 2013 or
2014.\

-   Character sheets, one for each player. You can download these
    from [www.evilhat.com](http://www.evilhat.com/).
-   Index cards or sticky notes or similar slips of paper.
-   Tokens for fate points. These can be poker chips, beads, pennies, or
    anything similar. Get a handful—about 30 or 40.

Next, let’s talk about how to use Fate Accelerated to tell stories together. 

 

Telling Stories Together {#sigil_toc_id_1 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
========================

So you’ve gathered your friends, your dice, and your index cards, and you’re
ready to play Fate Accelerated Edition (we’ll call it FAE from now on). Time to
tell some stories!

What Do You Mean, “Tell Stories”? {#sigil_toc_id_2 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
---------------------------------

FAE is all about telling stories. You create a group of characters and follow
them through some imaginary adventure that you all take turns telling little
parts of.

Think about a movie, video game, or TV show you like where the characters go on
adventures—something like The Legend of Korra or Star Wars or The Avengers or
the Zelda games or Doctor Whoor The Lord of the Rings. Now imagine a similar
sort of story, where you and your friends around the table make the decisions
for the characters as they move through the story, and the story changes as you
make those decisions.

Sometimes someone makes a decision to try something and you don’t know for sure
how it would turn out; that’s when you roll dice to see what happens next. The
higher you roll, the better the chance that things work out the way you want
them to.

So How Do We Do It? {#sigil_toc_id_3 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
-------------------

Well, first you need to figure out what kind of story you’re going to tell.
What genre are you interested in? Fantasy? Science fiction? Modern-day
adventure? Will you play in the world of a TV show or comic book or movie that
you love, or will you create your own world? For some great advice about how to
design the framework of your game, see Game Creation in Fate Core, available
for free at [www.evilhat.com](http://www.evilhat.com/).

Next, it’s time to choose who will be the players, and who will be the
gamemaster. Of the people around the table, all but one are referred to
as players. Each player takes on the role of one player character or PC in the
story, and puts themselves in their character’s shoes to make the decisions
that their character would make. The remaining person is called
the [gamemaster](#Anchor-11) or GM. The GM’s job is to present challenges to
the players and to portray all the characters that aren’t controlled by the
players (non-player characters or NPCs).

Once you decide who the GM will be, and what the genre and framework of the
story will be, it’s time for the players to make their characters—that’s in
the [**next chapter**](#Who).

### Telling Stories “Together”? What Do You Mean? {#sigil_toc_id_4 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

All the people at the table, GM and players alike, are responsible for telling
the story. When you make a decision for your character (or for one of the NPCs,
if you’re the GM), think about two things.

First, put yourself in your character’s shoes and think hard about what they
would do—even if it’s not the best idea. If you’re playing a character that
sometimes makes poor decisions, don’t be afraid to make a poor decision for
them on purpose.

Second—and this is really important—think about the story that’s being told.
Think about the choice that would make that story even better: more
interesting, more exciting, funnier. Would a certain choice give another
player’s character a chance to be awesome? Strongly consider making that
choice.

That’s how you tell great stories together—by not being afraid for your
character to make mistakes, and by making choices that make the story more
interesting for everyone at the table—not just you.

Who Do You Want To Be?\
 {#sigil_toc_id_5 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}
=======================

Once you’ve decided what kind of story you’ll be telling in your game, you
decide who your character is—what they look like, what they’re good at, and
what they believe.

What Kind of Characters Can I Play? {#sigil_toc_id_6 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}
-----------------------------------

Think about the setting that you’ve decided to play in and make that your main
guide. Are you playing in a school for young sorcerers? Play a young sorcerer!
Are you playing space pilots fighting an evil empire? Play a space pilot! Make
sure your character has a reason to interact and cooperate with the characters
the other players are making.

How Do I Make the Character? {#sigil_toc_id_7 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}
----------------------------

Now it’s time to start writing stuff down. Grab a pencil and a copy of the
character sheet. Some people like to use form-fillable PDFs on a laptop or
tablet computer. Any of that’s fine, but you definitely want something that
lets you erase and change.

### Aspects in a Nutshell {#sigil_toc_id_8 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

An aspect is a word, phrase, or sentence that describes something centrally
important to your character. It can be a motto your character lives by, a
personality quirk, a description of a relationship you have with another
character, an important possession or bit of equipment your character has, or
any other part of your character that is vitally important.

Aspects allow you to change the story in ways that tie in with your character’s
tendencies, skills, or problems. You can also use them to [**establish facts
about the setting**](#Anchor-14), such as the presence of magic or the
existence of a useful ally, dangerous enemy, or secret organization.

Your character will have a handful of aspects (between three and five),
including a high concept and a trouble. We discuss aspects in detail
in [*Aspects and Fate Points*](#aspects)—but for now, this should help you get
the idea.

### High Concept {#sigil_toc_id_9 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

First, decide on your character’s high concept. This is a single phrase or
sentence that neatly sums up your character, saying who you are, what you do,
what your “deal” is. When you think about your high concept, try to think of
two things: how this aspect could help you, and how it might make things harder
for you. Good high concept aspects do both.

* * * * *

Examples: Feline Captain of Cirrus Skimmer; Suncaller of the Andral
Desert; Chief Field Agent of IGEMA

* * * * *

### Trouble {#sigil_toc_id_10 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

Next, decide on the thing that always gets you into trouble. It could be a
personal weakness, or a recurring enemy, or an important obligation—anything
that makes your life complicated.

* * * * *

Examples: Steel Assassins Want Me Dead; Cast Now, Ask Questions Later; Gotta
Look Out for My Little Brother

* * * * *

### Another Aspect {#sigil_toc_id_11 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

Now compose another aspect. Think of something really important or interesting
about your character. Are they the strongest person in their hometown? Do they
carry a mighty sword known through history? Do they talk too much? Are they
filthy rich?

### Optional: One or Two Additional Aspects {#sigil_toc_id_12 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

If you wish, you may create one or two more aspects. These aspects might
describe your character’s relationship with other player characters or with an
NPC. Or, like the third aspect you composed above, it might describe something
especially interesting about your character.

If you prefer, you can leave one or both of these aspects blank right now and
fill them in later, after the game has started.

### Name and Appearance {#sigil_toc_id_13 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

Describe your character’s appearance and give them a name.

* * * * *

**CREATING CHARACTERS: THE 30-SECOND VERSION**

-   [Write two aspects](#Anchor-13): a high concept and a trouble.
-   Write another aspect.
-   Give your character a name and describe their appearance.
-   [Choose approaches](#Anchor-15).
-   Set your refresh to 3.
-   You may write up to two more aspects and [choose a stunt](#Anchor-16) if
    you wish, or you may do that during play.

* * * * *

### Approaches\
 {#sigil_toc_id_14 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

Choose your approaches.

Approaches are descriptions of how you accomplish tasks. Everyone has the same
six approaches:

-   Careful
-   Clever
-   Flashy
-   Forceful
-   Quick
-   Sneaky

Each approach is rated with a bonus. Choose one at Good (+3), two at Fair (+2),
two at Average (+1), and one at Mediocre (+0). You can improve these later. We
talk about [what each approach means](#sigil_toc_id_15) and how you use them
in [*How to Do Stuff: Outcomes, Approaches, and Actions*](#how).

* * * * *

**THE LADDER**

In Fate, we use a ladder of adjectives and numbers to rate a character’s
approaches, the result of a roll, difficulty ratings for simple checks, etc.

Here’s the ladder:

  ----- -----------
  +8    Legendary
  +7    ￼Epic
  ￼+6   Fantastic
  +5    ￼Superb
  ￼+4   Great
  ￼+3   Good
  +2    ￼Fair
  ￼+1   Average
  ￼0    Mediocre
  -1    ￼Poor
  ￼-2   Terrible
  ----- -----------

* * * * *

Your approaches can say a lot about who you are. Here are some examples:

-   The Brute:\
     Forceful +3, Careful and Flashy +2, Sneaky and Quick +1, Clever +0
-   The All-Star:\
     Quick +3, Forceful and Flashy +2, Clever and Careful +1, Sneaky +0
-   The Trickster:\
     Clever +3, Sneaky and Flashy +2, Forceful and Quick +1, Careful +0
-   The Guardian:\
     Careful +3, Forceful and Clever +2, Sneaky and Quick +1, Flashy +0
-   The Thief:\
     Sneaky +3, Careful and Quick +2, Clever and Flashy +1, Forceful +0
-   The Swashbuckler:\
     Flashy +3, Quick and Clever +2, Forceful and Sneaky +1, Careful +0

### Stunts and Refresh {#sigil_toc_id_16 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

A stunt is a special trait that changes the way an approach works for your
character. Generally, stunts give you a bonus (almost always +2) to a certain
approach when used with a particular action under specific circumstances. We’ll
talk more about stunts in [*Stunts*](#stunts). Choose one stunt to start, or
you can wait and add a stunt during the game. Later, when your character
advances, you can choose more.

Your refresh is the number of fate points you begin each game session
with—unless you ended the previous session with more unspent fate points than
your refresh, in which case you start with the number you had left last time.
By default, your refresh starts at three and is reduced by one for each
stunt after the first three you choose—essentially, your first three stunts are
free! As your character advances, you’ll get opportunities to add to your
refresh. Your refresh may never go below one.

* * * * *

**HOW MANY STUNTS?**

By default, FAE suggests choosing one stunt to start with.

However, if this is your first time playing a Fate game, you might find it
easier to pick your first stunt after you’ve had a chance to play a bit, to
give you an idea of what a good stunt might be. Just add your stunt during or
after your first game session.

On the other hand, if you’re an experienced Fate gamer, you might look ahead
and discover that, just like in Fate Core, your character is entitled to three
free stunts before it starts costing you refresh. In that case, let the least
experienced member of your game group be your guide; if someone is new to the
game and only takes one to start with, that’s what everyone should do. If
you’re all experienced, and you want to start with more powerful characters,
just take all three to start and off you go.

* * * * *

HowTo Do Stuff: Outcomes, Actions, and Approaches {#sigil_toc_id_17 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
=================================================

Now it’s time to start doing something. You need to leap from one moving train
car to another. You need to search the entire library for that spell you really
need. You need to distract the guard so you can sneak into the fortress. How do
you figure out what happens?

First you narrate what your character is trying to do. Your character’s own
aspects provide a good guide for what you can do. If you have an aspect that
suggests you can perform magic, then cast that spell. If your aspects describe
you as a swordsman, draw that blade and have at it. These story details don’t
have additional mechanical impact. You don’t get a bonus from your magic or
your sword, unless you choose to spend a fate point to invoke an
appropriate [aspect](#Anchor-18). Often, the ability to use an aspect to make
something true in the story is bonus enough!

How do you know if you’re successful? Often, you just succeed, because the
action isn’t hard and nobody’s trying to stop you. But if failure provides an
interesting twist in the story, or if something unpredictable could happen, you
need to break out the dice.

* * * * *

**TAKING ACTION: THE 30-SECOND VERSION**

1.  Describe what you want your character to do. See if someone or something
    can stop you.\
2.  Decide what action you’re taking: create an advantage, overcome, attack, or
    defend.\
3.  Decide on your approach.\
4.  Roll dice and add your approach’s bonus.\
5.  Decide whether to modify your roll with aspects.\
6.  Figure out your outcome.\

* * * * *

Dice or Cards {#sigil_toc_id_18 .Heading-2 .para-style-override-7 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
-------------

Part of determining your outcome is generating a random number, which is
usually done in one of two ways: rolling four Fate Dice, or drawing a card from
a Deck of Fate.

Fate Dice: Fate Dice (sometimes called Fudge dice, after the game they were
originally designed for) are one way to determine outcomes. You always roll
Fate Dice in a set of four. Each die will come up as [+], [ ], or [-], and you
add them together to get the total of the roll. For example:

\
 -+0+ = +1\
 +-00 = \
 +++- = +2\
 -000 = −1\

Deck of Fate: The Deck of Fate is a deck of cards that copies the statistical
spread of Fate Dice. You can choose to use them instead of dice—either one
works great.

* * * * *

These rules are written with the assumption that you’re rolling Fate Dice, but
use whichever one your group prefers. Anytime you’re told to roll dice, that
also means you can draw from the Deck of Fate instead.\

* * * * *

Outcomes {#sigil_toc_id_15 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
--------

Once you roll your dice, add your approach bonus (we’ll talk about that in a
moment) and any bonuses from aspects or stunts. Compare the total to a target
number, which is either a [fixed difficulty](#Setting-Difficulty-Levels) or the
result of the GM’s roll for an NPC. Based on that comparison, your outcome is:

-   You fail if your total is less than your opponent’s total.
-   It’s a tie if your total is equal to your opponent’s total.
-   You succeed if your total is greater than your opponent’s total.
-   You succeed with style if your total is at least three greater than your
    opponent’s total.

Now that we’ve covered outcomes, we can talk about actions and how the outcomes
work with them.

Actions {#sigil_toc_id_19 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
-------

So you’ve narrated what your PC is trying to do, and you’ve established that
there’s a chance you could fail. Next, figure out what action best describes
what you’re trying to do. There are four basic actions that cover anything you
do in the game.

### Create an Advantage {#sigil_toc_id_20 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

Creating an advantage is anything you do to try to help yourself or one of your
friends. Taking a moment to very carefully aim your proton blaster, spending
several hours doing research in the school library, or tripping the thug who’s
trying to rob you—these all count as creating an advantage. The target of your
action may get a chance to use the defend action to stop you. The advantage you
create lets you do one of the following three things:

-   Discover an existing situation [aspect](#Situation-Aspects).
-   Discover an existing situation [aspect](#Character-Aspects) or another
    character’s aspect that you didn’t know about.
-   Take advantage of an existing [aspect](#aspects).

If you’re creating a new aspect or discovering an existing one:

-   -   **If you fail:** Either you don’t create or discover the aspect at all,
        or you create or discover it but anopponent gets to invoke the aspect
        for free. The second option works best if the aspect you create or
        discover is something that other people could take advantage of
        (like Rough Terrain). You may have to reword the aspect to show that it
        benefits the other character instead of you—work it out in whatever way
        makes the most sense with the player who gets the free invocation. You
        can still invoke the aspect if you’d like, but it’ll cost you a fate
        point.
    -   **If you tie:** If you’re creating a new aspect, you get
        a [**boost**](#Boosts). Name it and invoke it once for free—after that,
        the boost goes away. If you’re trying to discover an existing aspect,
        treat this as a success (see below).
    -   If you succeed: You create or discover the aspect, and you or an ally
        may invoke it once for free. Write the aspect on an index card or
        sticky note and place it on the table.
    -   If you succeed with style: You create or discover the aspect, and you
        or an ally may invoke it twicefor free. Usually you can’t invoke the
        same aspect twice on the same roll, but this is an exception; success
        with style gives you a BIG advantage!

If you’re trying to take advantage of an aspect you already know about:

-   If you fail: You don’t get any additional benefit from the aspect. You can
    still invoke it in the future if you’d like, at the cost of a fate point.
-   If you tie or succeed: You get one free invocation on the aspect for you or
    an ally to use later. You might want to draw a circle or a box on the
    aspect’s note card, and check it off when that invocation is used.
-   If you succeed with style: You get two free invocations on the aspect,
    which you can let an ally use, if you wish.

* * * * *

**ACTIONS & OUTCOMES: THE 30-SECOND VERSION**

**Create an Advantage when creating or discovering aspects:**

-   **Fail:** Don’t create or discover, or you do but your opponent (not you)
    gets a free invocation.
-   **Tie:** Get a boost if creating new, or treat as success if looking for
    existing.
-   **Succeed:** Create or discover the aspect, get a free invocation on it.
-   **Succeed with Style: **Create or discover the aspect, get two free
    invocations on it.

**Create an Advantage on an aspect you already know about:**

-   **Fail:** No additional benefit.
-   **Tie**: Generate one free invocation on the aspect.
-   **Succeed:** Generate one free invocation on the aspect.
-   **Succeed with Style:** Generate two free invocations on the aspect.

**Overcome:**

-   ****Fail:** **Fail, or succeed at a serious cost.
-   ****Tie:** **Succeed at minor cost.
-   **Succeed:** You accomplish your goal.
-   **Succeed with Style:** You accomplish your goal and generate a boost.

**Attack:**

-   **Fail:** No effect.
-   ****Tie:** **Attack doesn’t harm the target, but you gain a boost.
-   **Succeed:** Attack hits and causes damage.
-   ****Succeed with Style:** **Attack hits and causes damage. May reduce
    damage by one to generate a boost.

**Defend:**

-   **Fail:** You suffer the consequences of your opponent’s success.
-   **Tie:** Look at your opponent’s action to see what happens.
-   ****Succeed:** **Your opponent doesn’t get what they want.
-   **Succeed with Style:** Your opponent doesn’t get what they want, and you
    get a boost.

* * * * *

### Overcome {#sigil_toc_id_21 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

You use the **[overcome](#Setting-Difficulty-Levels) **action when you have to
get past something that’s between you and a particular goal—picking a lock,
escaping from handcuffs, leaping across a chasm, flying a spaceship through an
asteroid field. Taking some action to [eliminate or change an inconvenient
situation aspect](#get-rid-of-a-situation-aspect) is usually an overcome
action; we’ll talk more about that in Aspects and Fate Points. The target of
your action may get a chance to use the defend action to stop you.

-   If you fail: You have a tough choice to make. You can simply fail—the door
    is still locked, the thug still stands between you and the exit, the enemy
    spaceship is still On Your Tail. Or you can succeed, but at a serious
    cost—maybe you drop something vital you were carrying, maybe you suffer
    harm. The GM helps you figure out an appropriate cost.
-   If you tie: You attain your goal, but at some minor cost. The GM could
    introduce a complication, or present you with a tough choice (you can
    rescue one of your friends, but not the other), or some other twist.
    See “Succeed at a Cost” in Running the Game in Fate Core for more ideas.
-   If you succeed: You accomplish what you were trying to do. The lock springs
    open, you duck around the thug blocking the door, you manage to lose the
    alien spaceship on your tail.
-   If you succeed with style: As success (above), but you also gain a boost.

### Attack {#sigil_toc_id_22 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

Use an attack when you try to hurt someone, whether physically or
mentally—swinging a sword, shooting a blaster rifle, or yelling a blistering
insult with the intent to hurt your target. (We’ll talk about this in Ouch!
Damage, Stress, and Consequences, but the important thing is: If someone gets
hurt too badly, they’re knocked out of the scene.) The target of your attack
gets a chance to use the defend action to stop you.

-   If you fail: Your attack doesn’t connect. The target parries your sword,
    your shot misses, your target laughs off your insult.
-   If you tie: Your attack doesn’t connect strongly enough to cause any harm,
    but you gain a boost.
-   If you succeed: Your attack hits and you do damage. See [*Ouch! Damage,
    Stress, and Consequences*](#ouch).
-   If you succeed with style: You hit and [do damage](#Anchor-22), plus you
    have the option to reduce the damage your hit causes by one and gain a
    boost.

### Defend {#sigil_toc_id_23 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

Use defend when you’re actively trying to stop someone from doing any of the
other three actions—you’re parrying a sword strike, trying to stay on your
feet, blocking a doorway, and the like. Usually this action is performed
onsomeone else’s turn, reacting to their attempt to attack, overcome, or create
an advantage. You may also roll to oppose some non-attack actions, or to defend
against an attack on someone else, if you can explain why you can. Usually it’s
fine if most people at the table agree that it’s reasonable, but you can also
point to an relevant situation aspect to justify it. When you do, you become
the target for any bad results.

-   If you fail: You’re on the receiving end of whatever your opponent’s
    success gives them.
-   If you tie or succeed: Things don’t work out too badly for you; look at the
    description of your opponent’s action to see what happens.
-   If you succeed with style: Your opponent doesn’t get what they want, plus
    you gain a boost.

### Getting Help {#sigil_toc_id_24 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

An ally can help you perform your action. When an ally helps you, they give up
their action for the exchange and describe how they’re providing the help; you
get a +1 to your roll for each ally that helps this way. Usually only one or
two people can help this way before they start getting in each other’s way; the
GM decides how many people can help at once.

Choose Your Approach {#sigil_toc_id_25 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
--------------------

As we mentioned in [Who Do You Want to Be?](#Who), there are
six approaches that describe how you perform actions.

-   Careful: A Careful action is when you pay close attention to detail and
    take your time to do the job right. Lining up a long-range arrow shot.
    Attentively standing watch. Disarming a bank’s alarm system.
-   Clever: A Clever action requires that you think fast, solve problems, or
    account for complex variables. Finding the weakness in an enemy swordsman’s
    style. Finding the weak point in a fortress wall. Fixing a computer.
-   Flashy: A Flashy action draws attention to you; it’s full of style and
    panache. Delivering an inspiring speech to your army. Embarrassing your
    opponent in a duel. Producing a magical fireworks display.
-   Forceful: A Forceful action isn’t subtle—it’s brute strength. Wrestling a
    bear. Staring down a thug. Casting a big, powerful magic spell.
-   Quick: A Quick action requires that you move quickly and with dexterity.
    Dodging an arrow. Getting in the first punch. Disarming a bomb as it ticks
    3… 2… 1…
-   Sneaky: A Sneaky action is done with an emphasis on misdirection, stealth,
    or deceit. Talking your way out of getting arrested. Picking a pocket.
    Feinting in a sword fight.

Each character has each approach rated with a bonus from +0 to +3. Add the
bonus to your dice roll to determine how well your PC performs the action you
described.

So your first instinct is probably to pick the action that gives you the
greatest bonus, right? But it doesn’t work like that. You have to base your
choice of approach on the description of your action, and you can’t describe an
action that doesn’t make any sense. Would you Forcefully creep through a dark
room, hiding from the guards? No, that’s being Sneaky. Would you Quickly push
that big rock out of the way of the wagon? No, that’s being Forceful.
Circumstances constrain what approach you can use, so sometimes you have to go
with an approach that might not play directly to your strengths.

Roll the Dice, Add Your Bonus {#sigil_toc_id_26 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
-----------------------------

Time to take up dice and roll. Take the bonus associated with the approach
you’ve chosen and add it to the result on the dice. If you have a stunt that
applies, add that too. That’s your total. Compare it to what your opponent
(usually the GM) has.

Decide Whether to Modify the Roll {#sigil_toc_id_27 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
---------------------------------

Finally, decide whether you want to alter your roll by [invoking
aspects](#Anchor-18)—we’ll talk about this a lot inAspects and Fate Points.

Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts {#sigil_toc_id_28 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start;"}
===================================

We’ve talked about the four actions (create an advantage, overcome, attack, and
defend) and the four outcomes (fail, tie, succeed, and succeed with style). But
in what framework do those happen?

Usually, when you want to do something straightforward—swim across a raging
river, hack someone’s cell phone—all you need to do is make one overcome
action [against a difficulty level](#Setting-Difficulty-Levels) that the GM
sets. You look at your outcome and go from there.

But sometimes things are a little more complex.

Challenges {#sigil_toc_id_29 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start;"}
----------

A challenge is a series of overcome and create an advantage actions that you
use to resolve an especially complicated situation. Each overcome action deals
with one task or part of the situation, and you take the individual results
together to figure out how the situation resolves.

To set up a challenge, decide what individual tasks or goals make up the
situation, and treat each one as a separate overcome roll.

Depending on the situation, one character may be required to make several
rolls, or multiple characters may be able to participate. GMs, you aren’t
obligated to announce all the stages in the challenge ahead of time—adjust the
steps as the challenge unfolds to keep things exciting.

* * * * *

The PCs are the crew of a ship caught in a storm. They decide to press on and
try to get to their destination despite the weather, and the GM suggests this
sounds like a challenge. Steps in resolving this challenge could be calming
panicky passengers, repairing damaged rigging, and keeping the ship on the
right heading.

* * * * *

Contests {#sigil_toc_id_30 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start;"}
--------

When two or more characters are competing against one another for the same
goal, but not directly trying to hurt each other, you have a contest. Examples
include a car chase, a public debate, or an archery tournament.

A contest proceeds in a series of exchanges. In an exchange, every participant
takes one overcome action to determine how well they do in that leg of the
contest. Compare your result to everyone else’s.

If you got the highest result, you win the exchange—you score a victory (which
you can represent with a tally or check mark on scratch paper) and describe how
you take the lead. If you succeed with style, you mark two victories.

If there’s a tie, no one gets a victory, and an unexpected twist occurs. This
could mean several things, depending on the situation—the terrain or
environment shifts somehow, the parameters of the contest change, or an
unanticipated variable shows up and affects all the participants. The
GM [creates a new situation aspect ](#Situation-Aspects)reflecting this change
and puts it into play.

The first participant to achieve three victories wins the contest.

Conflicts {#sigil_toc_id_31 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start;"}
---------

Conflicts are used to resolve situations where characters are trying to harm
one another. It could be physical harm (a sword fight, a wizard’s duel, a
battle with laser blasters), but it could also be mental harm (a shouting
match, a tough interrogation, a magical psychic assault).

* * * * *

**CONFLICTS: THE 30-SECOND VERSION**

1.  1. Set the scene.
2.  2. Determine turn order.
3.  3. Start the first exchange.

-   On your turn, take an action.

-   On other people’s turns, defend against or respond to their actions as
    necessary.
-   At the end of everyone’s turn, start a new exchange or end the conflict.

* * * * *

### Setting the Scene {#sigil_toc_id_32 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start;"}

Establish what’s going on, where everyone is, and what the environment is like.
Who is the opposition? The GM should write a couple of situation aspects on
sticky notes or index cards and place them on the table. Players [can suggest
situation aspects](), too.

The GM also establishes zones, loosely defined areas that tell you where
characters are. You determine zones based on the scene and the following
guidelines:

Generally, you can interact with other characters in the same zone—or in nearby
zones if you can justify acting at a distance (for example, if you have a
ranged weapon or magic spell).

You can move one zone for free. An action is required to move if there’s an
obstacle along the way, such as someone trying to stop you, or if you want to
move two or more zones. It sometimes helps to sketch a quick map to illustrate
zones.

* * * * *

Thugs are attacking the characters in a house. The living room is one zone, the
kitchen another, the front porch another, and the yard a fourth. Anyone in the
same zone can easily throw punches at each other. From the living room, you can
throw things at people in the kitchen or move into the kitchen as a free
action, unless the doorway is blocked. To get from the living room to the front
porch or yard requires an action.

* * * * *

### Determine Turn Order {#sigil_toc_id_33 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start;"}

Your turn order in a conflict is based on your approaches. In a physical
conflict, compare your Quick approach to the other participants’—the one with
the fastest reflexes goes first. In a mental conflict, compare your Careful
approach—attention to detail will warn you of danger. Whoever has the highest
approach gets to go first, and then everyone else goes in descending order.
Break ties in whatever manner makes sense, with the GM having the last word.

GMs, it’s simplest if you pick your most advantageous NPC to determine your
place in the turn order, and let all your NPCs go at that time. But if you have
a good reason to determine turn order individually for all your NPCs, go right
ahead.

### Exchanges {#sigil_toc_id_34 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start;"}

Next, each character takes a turn in order. On their turn, a character can take
one of the [four actions](#Anchor-24). Resolve the action to determine the
outcome. The conflict is over when only one side has characters still in the
fight.

Ouch! Damage, Stress, and Consequences {#sigil_toc_id_35 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
======================================

When you’re hit by an attack, the severity of the hit is the difference between
the attack roll and your defense roll; we measure that in shifts. For instance,
if your opponent gets +5 on their attack and you get a +3 on your defense, the
attack deals a two shift hit (5 – 3 = 2).

Then, one of two things happens:

-   You suffer stress and/or consequences, but you stay in the fight.
-   You get taken out, which means you’re out of the action for a while.

* * * * *

**STRESS & CONSEQUENCES: THE 30-SECOND VERSION**

-   Each character starts with three stress boxes.
-   Severity of hit (in shifts)\
     = Attack Roll – Defense Roll
-   When you take a hit, you need to account for how that hit damages you. One
    way to absorb the damage is to take stress; you can check one stress box to
    handle some or all of a single hit. You can absorb a number of shifts equal
    to the number of the box you check: one for Box 1, two for Box 2, three for
    Box 3.
-   You may also take one or more consequences to deal with the hit, by marking
    off one or more consequence slots and writing a new aspect for each one.
    Mild consequence = 2 shifts; moderate = 4 shifts; severe = 6 shifts.
-   If you can’t (or decide not to) handle the entire hit, you’re taken out.
    Your opponent decides what happens to you.
-   Giving in before your opponent’s roll allows you to control how you exit
    the scene. You also get one or more fate points for doing this!
-   Stress and mild consequences vanish at the end of the scene, provided you
    get a chance to rest. Other consequences take longer.

* * * * *

\
 What Is Stress? {#sigil_toc_id_36 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal;"}
----------------

If you get hit and don’t want to be taken out, you can choose to take stress.

Stress represents you getting tired or annoyed, taking a superficial wound, or
some other condition that goes away quickly.

Your character sheet has a stress track, a row of three boxes. When you take a
hit and check a stress box, the box absorbs a number of shifts equal to its
number: one shift for Box 1, two for Box 2, or three for Box 3.

You can only check one stress box for any single hit, but you can check a
stress box and take one or more consequences at the same time. You can’t check
a stress box that already has a check mark in it!

What Are Consequences? {#sigil_toc_id_37 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal;"}
----------------------

Consequences are new aspects that you take to reflect being seriously hurt in
some way. Your character sheet has three slots where you can write
consequences. Each one is labeled with a number: 2 (mild consequence), 4
(moderate consequence), or 6 (severe consequence). This represents the number
of shifts of the hit the consequence absorbs. You can mark off as many of these
as you like to handle a single hit, but only if that slot was blank to start
with. If you already have a moderate consequence written down, you can’t take
another one until you do something to make the first one go away!

A major downside of consequences is that each consequence is a new aspect that
your opponents can invoke against you. The more you take, the more vulnerable
you are. And just like situation aspects, the character that creates it (in
this case, the character that hit you) gets one free invocation on that
consequence. They can choose to let one of their allies use the free
invocation.

* * * * *

Let’s say that you get hit really hard and take a 4-shift hit. You check Box 2
on your stress track, which leaves you with 2 shifts to deal with. If you
can’t, you’re taken out, so it’s time for a consequence. You can choose to
write a new aspect in the consequence slot labeled 2—say, Sprained Ankle. Those
final 2 shifts are taken care of and you can keep fighting!

* * * * *

If you’re unable to absorb all of a hit’s shifts—by checking a stress box,
taking consequences, or both—you’re taken out.

What Happens When I Get Taken Out? {#sigil_toc_id_38 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal;"}
----------------------------------

If you get taken out, you can no longer act in the scene. Whoever takes you out
narrates what happens to you. It should make sense based on how you got taken
out—maybe you run from the room in shame, or maybe you get knocked unconscious.

Giving In {#sigil_toc_id_39 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal;"}
---------

If things look grim for you, you can give in (or concede the fight)—but you
have to say that’s what you’re going to do before your opponent rolls their
dice.

This is different than being taken out, because you get a say in what happens
to you. Your opponent gets some major concession from you—talk about what makes
sense in your situation—but it beats getting taken out and having no say at
all.

Additionally, you get one fate point for conceding, and one fate point for each
consequence you took in this conflict. This is your chance to say, “You win
this round, but I’ll get you next time!” and get a tall stack of fate points to
back it up.

Getting Better—Recovering from Stress and Consequences {#sigil_toc_id_40 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal;"}
------------------------------------------------------

At the end of each scene, clear all of your stress boxes. Recovery from a
consequence is a bit more complicated; you need to explain how you recover from
it—whether that’s an ER visit, taking a walk to calm down, or whatever makes
sense with the consequence. You also need to wait an appropriate length of
time.

-   Mild consequence: Clear it at the end of the scene, provided you get a
    chance to rest.
-   Moderate consequence: Clear it at the end of the next session, provided it
    makes sense within the story.
-   Severe consequence: Clear it at the end of the [*scenario*](#scenario),
    provided it makes sense within the story.

* * * * *

**RENAMING MODERATE AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES**

Moderate and severe consequences stick around for a while. Therefore, at some
point you may want to change the name of the aspect to better fit what’s going
on in the story. For instance, after you get some medical help, Painful Broken
Leg might make more sense if you change it to Hobbling on Crutches.

Aspects and Fate Points\
 {#sigil_toc_id_41 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
========================

An aspect is a word or phrase that describes something special about a person,
place, thing, situation, or group. Almost anything you can think of can have
aspects. A person might be the Greatest Swordswoman on the Cloud Sea. A room
might be On Fire after you knock over an oil lamp. After a time-travel
encounter with a dinosaur, you might be Terrified. Aspects let you change the
story in ways that go along with your character’s tendencies, skills, or
problems.

You spend fate points—which you keep track of with pennies or glass beads or
poker chips or some other tokens—to unlock the power of aspects and make them
help you. You earn fate points by letting a character aspect be compelled
against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder. Be sure to
keep track of the fate points you have left at the end of the session—if you
have [more than your refresh](#refresh), you start the next session with the
fate points you ended this session with.

* * * * *

You earned a lot of fate points during your game session, ending the day with
five fate points. Your refresh is 2, so you’ll start with five fate points the
next time you play. But another player ends the same session with just one fate
point. His refresh is 3, so he’ll begin the next session with 3 fate points,
not just the one he had left over.

* * * * *

What Kinds of Aspects Are There? {#sigil_toc_id_42 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
--------------------------------

There’s an endless variety of aspects, but no matter what they’re called they
all work pretty much the same way. The main difference is how long they stick
around before going away.

Character Aspects: These aspects are on your character sheet, such as
your [high concept](#Anchor-26) and [trouble](#Anchor-27). They describe
personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have
with others, important items or titles you possess, problems you’re dealing
with or goals you’re working toward, or reputations and obligations you carry.
These aspects only change under very unusual circumstances; most never will.

* * * * *

Examples: Captain of the Skyship Nimbus; On the Run From the Knights of the
Circle;Attention to Detail; I Must Protect My Brother

* * * * *

\

Situation Aspects: These aspects describe the surroundings that the action is
taking place in. This includes aspects you create or discover using the create
an advantage action. A situation aspect usually vanishes at the end of the
scene it was part of, or when someone takes some action that would change or
get rid of it. Essentially, they last only as long as the situational element
they represent lasts.

* * * * *

Examples: On Fire; Bright Sunlight; Crowd of Angry People; Knocked to the
Ground

* * * * *

To get rid of a situation aspect, you can attempt an overcome action to
eliminate it, provided you can think of a way your character could accomplish
it—dump a bucket of water on the Raging Fire, use evasive maneuvers to escape
the enemy fighter that’s On Your Tail. An opponent may use a Defend action to
try to preserve the aspect, if they can describe how they do it.

Consequences: These aspects represent injuries or other lasting trauma that
happen when you get hit by attacks. [They go away slowly](#Anchor-29), as
described in Ouch! Damage, Stress, and Consequences.

* * * * *

Examples: Sprained Ankle; Fear of Spiders; Concussion; Debilitating Self-Doubt

* * * * *

Boosts: A boost is a temporary aspect that you get to use once (see “What Do
You Do With Aspects?”next), then it vanishes. Unused boosts vanish when the
scene they were created in is over or when the advantage they represent no
longer exists. These represent very brief and fleeting advantages you get in
conflicts with others.

* * * * *

Examples: In My Sights; Distracted; Unstable Footing; Rock in His Boot

* * * * *

**PVP**\

The only time that fate point might not go to the GM is when you’re in conflict
with another player. If you are, and you invoke one of that player’s character
aspects to help you out against them, they will get the fate point instead of
the GM once the scene is over.

* * * * *

What Do You Do With Aspects? {#sigil_toc_id_43 .Heading-2 .para-style-override-7 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
----------------------------

There are three big things you can do with
aspects: invoke aspects, compel aspects, and use aspects to establish facts.

### Invoking Aspects {#sigil_toc_id_44 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

You invoke an aspect to give yourself a bonus or make things a bit harder for
your opponent. You can invoke any aspect that you a) know about, and b) can
explain how you use it to your advantage—including aspects on other characters
or on the situation. Normally, invoking an aspect costs you a fate point—hand
one of your fate points to the GM. To invoke an aspect, you need to describe
how that aspect helps you in your current situation.

* * * * *

-   I attack the zombie with my sword. I know zombies are Sluggish, so that
    should help me.
-   I really want to scare this guy. I’ve heard he’s Scared of Mice, so I’ll
    release a mouse in his bedroom.
-   Now that the guard’s Distracted, I should be able to sneak right by him.
-   This spell needs to be really powerful—I’m an Archwizard of the Ancient
    Order, and powerful spells are my bread and butter.

* * * * *

\

What does invoking the aspect get you? Choose one of the following effects:

-   Add a +2 bonus to your total. This costs a fate point.
-   Reroll the dice. This option is best if you rolled really lousy (usually a
    −3 or −4 showing on the dice). This costs a fate point.
-   Confront an opponent with the aspect. You use this option when your
    opponent is trying something and you think an existing aspect would make it
    harder for them. For instance, an alien thug wants to draw his blaster
    pistol, but he’s Buried in Debris; you spend a fate point to invoke that
    aspect, and now your opponent’s level of difficulty is increased by +2.
-   Help an ally with the aspect. Use this option when a friend could use some
    help and you think an existing aspect would make it easier for them. You
    spend a fate point to invoke the aspect, and now your friend gets a +2 on
    their roll.

Important: You can only invoke any aspect once on a given dice roll; you can’t
spend a stack of fate points on one aspect and get a huge bonus from it.
However, you can invoke several different aspects on the same roll.

If you’re invoking an aspect to add a bonus or reroll your dice, wait
until after you’ve rolled to do it. No sense spending a fate point if you don’t
need to!

Free invocations: [Sometimes you can invoke an aspect for
free](#succeed-with-style), without paying a fate point. If you create or
discover an aspect through the create an advantage action, the first invocation
on it (by you or an ally) is free (if you succeeded with style, you
get two freebies). If you cause a consequence through an attack, you or an ally
can invoke it once for free. A [**boost**](#Boosts) is a special kind of aspect
that grants one free invocation, then it vanishes.

### Compelling Aspects {#sigil_toc_id_45 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

If you’re in a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means
your character’s life is more dramatic or complicated, anyone can compel the
aspect. You can even compel it on yourself—that’s called a self-compel. Compels
are the most common way for players to earn more fate points.

There are two types of compels.

Decision compels: This sort of compel suggests the answer to a decision your
character has to make. If your character is Princess of Alaria, for example,
you may need to stay to lead the defense of the Royal Alarian Castle rather
than fleeing to safety. Or if you have a Defiant Streak a Mile Wide, maybe you
can’t help but mouth off to the Dean of Discipline when he questions you.

Event compels: Other times a compel reflects something happening that makes
life more complicated for you. If you have Strange Luck, of course that spell
you’re working on in class accidentally turns the dour Potions Master’s hair
orange. If you Owe Don Valdeon a Favor, then Don Valdeon shows up and demands
that you perform a service for him just when it’s least convenient.

In any case, when an aspect is compelled against you, the person compelling it
offers you a fate point and suggests that the aspect has a certain effect—that
you’ll make a certain decision or that a particular event will occur. You can
discuss it back and forth, proposing tweaks or changes to the suggested compel.
After a moment or two, you need to decide whether to accept the compel. If you
agree, you take the fate point and your character makes the suggested decision
or the event happens. If you refuse, you must pay a fate point from your own
supply. Yes, this means that if you don’t have any fate points, you can’t
refuse a compel!

* * * * *

**How Many Fate Points Does the GM Get?**

As GM, you don’t need to track fate points for each NPC, but that doesn’t mean
you get an unlimited number. Start each scene with a pool of one fate point per
PC that’s in the scene. Spend fate points from this pool to invoke aspects (and
consequences) against the PCs. When it’s empty, you can’t invoke aspects
against them.

How can you increase the size of your pool? When a player compels one of an
NPC’s aspects, add the fate point to your pool. If that compel ends the scene,
or when an NPC gives in, instead add those fate points to your pool at the
start of the next scene.

Fate points you award for compels do NOT come from this pool. You never have to
worry about running out of fate points to award for compels.

* * * * *

### Establishing Facts {#sigil_toc_id_46 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

The final thing that aspects can do is establish facts in the game. You don’t
have to spend any fate points, roll dice, or anything to make this happen—just
by virtue of having the aspect Ruddy Duck’s Pilot, you’ve established that your
character is a pilot and that you fly a plane named the Ruddy Duck. Having the
aspect Mortal Enemy: The Red Ninjas establishes that the setting has an
organization called the Red Ninjas and that they’re after you for some reason.
If you take the aspect Sorcerer of the Mysterious Circle, you not only
establish that there’s a group of sorcerers called the Mysterious Circle, but
that magic exists in the setting and that you can perform it.

When you establish facts of the setting this way, make sure you do it in
cooperation with other players. If most people want to play in a setting
without magic, you shouldn’t unilaterally bring magic into it through an
aspect. Make sure that the facts you establish through your aspects make the
game fun for everyone.

\

Composing Good Aspects {#sigil_toc_id_47 .Heading-2 .para-style-override-7 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
----------------------

\

When you need to think of a good aspect (we’re mainly talking about character
and situation aspects here), think about two things:

-   How the aspect might help you—when you’d invoke it.
-   How it might hurt you—when it would be compelled against you.

For example:

* * * * *

I’ll Get You, von Stendahl!

-   Invoke this when acting against von Stendahl to improve your chances.
-   Get a fate point when your dislike for von Stendahl makes you do something
    foolish to try to get him.

Hair Trigger Nerves

-   Invoke this when being extra vigilant and careful would help you.
-   Get a fate point when this causes you to be jumpy and be distracted by
    threats that aren’t really there.

* * * * *

Obviously, your trouble aspect is supposed to cause problems—and thereby make
your character’s life more interesting and get you fate points—so it’s okay if
that one’s a little more one-dimensional, but other character and situation
aspects should be double-edged.

Stunts are tricks, maneuvers, or techniques your character has that change how
an approach works for your character. Generally this means [you get a bonus in
certain situations](#Anchor-15), but sometimes it gives you some other ability
or characteristic. A stunt can also reflect specialized, high-quality, or
exotic equipment that your character has access to that gives them a frequent
edge over other characters.

There’s no definitive list of stunts that you pick from; much like aspects,
everyone composes their own stunts. There are two basic templates to guide you
in composing your stunts, so you do have something to work from.

The first type of stunt gives you a +2 bonus when you use a certain approach in
a certain situation. Use this template:

Because I [describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear,
or are otherwise awesome], I get a +2 when I [pick one: Carefully, Cleverly,
Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily][pick one: attack, defend, create
advantages, overcome] when [describe a circumstance].

For example:

* * * * *

-   Because I am a Smooth Talker, I get a +2 when I Sneakily create
    advantages when I’m in conversation with someone.
-   Because I am a Lover of Puzzles, I get a +2 when I Cleverly overcome
    obstacles when I am presented with a puzzle, riddle, or similar conundrum.
-   Because I am a World-Class Duelist, I get a +2 when I Flashily
    attack when engaged in a one-on-one swordfight.
-   Because I have a Big Kite Shield, I get a +2 when I Forcefully
    defend when I use my shield in close combat.

* * * * *

Sometimes, if the circumstance is especially restrictive, you can apply the
stunt to both the create an advantage action and the overcome action.

The second type of stunt lets you make something true, do something cool, or
otherwise ignore the usual rules in some way. Use this template:

Because I [describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear,
or are otherwise awesome], once per game session I can [describe something cool
you can do].

For example:

* * * * *

-   Because I am Well Connected, once per game session I can find a helpful
    ally in just the right place.
-   Because I am Quick on the Draw, once per game session I can choose to go
    first in a physical conflict.
-   Because I can Run Circles Around a Leopard, once per game session I
    can show up anywhere I want to, provided I could run there, no matter where
    I started.

* * * * *

These templates exist to give you an idea of how stunts should be constructed,
but don’t feel constrained to follow them exactly if you have a good idea. If
you’d like to read more about the construction of stunts, see Skills and
Stunts in Fate Core.

Getting Better at Doing Stuff: Character Advancement {#sigil_toc_id_49 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}
====================================================

People change. Your skills sharpen as you practice them. Your life experiences
accumulate and shape your personality. Fate Accelerated Edition reflects that
with character advancement, which allows you to change your aspects, add or
change stunts, and raise your approach bonuses. You do this when your character
reaches a milestone.

Milestones {#sigil_toc_id_50 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}
----------

Stories in TV shows, comic books, movies, and even video games usually continue
from episode to episode, season to season. It took Frodo three big books to
take the Ring to the fiery mountain. It took Aang three seasons to defeat the
Fire Lord. You get the idea. FAE can tell those kinds of stories; you play many
game sessions in a row using the same characters—this is often called
a campaign—and the story builds on itself. But within these long stories, there
are shorter story arcs, like single episodes of a TV show or single issues of a
comic, where shorter stories are told and wrapped up. FAE can do that too, even
within a longer campaign.

In FAE, we call those wrap-ups milestones—whether they’re small ones for short
stories, or really big ones at the end of many sessions of play. FAE recognizes
three types of milestones, and each one allows you to change your character in
certain ways.

### Minor Milestones {#sigil_toc_id_51 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

A minor milestone usually occurs at the end of a session of play, or when one
piece of a story has been resolved. Rather than making your character more
powerful, this kind of milestone is more about changing your character, about
adjusting in response to whatever’s going on in the story if you need to.
Sometimes it won’t really make sense to take advantage of a minor milestone,
but you always have the opportunity in case you need to.

After a minor milestone, you can choose to do one (and only one) of the
following:

-   Switch the ratings of any two approaches.
-   Rename one aspect that isn’t your high concept.
-   Exchange one stunt for a different stunt.
-   Choose a new stunt (and adjust your refresh, if you already have three
    stunts).

Also, if you have a moderate consequence, check to see if it’s been around for
two sessions. If so, you can clear it.

### Significant Milestones {#sigil_toc_id_52 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

\

A significant milestone usually occurs at the end of a [scenario](#scenario) or
the conclusion of a big plot event (or, when in doubt, at the end of every two
or three sessions). Unlike minor milestones, which are primarily about change,
significant milestones are about learning new things—dealing with problems and
challenges has made your character generally more capable at what they do.

In addition to the benefit of a minor milestone, you also gain both of the
following:

-   If you have a severe consequence that’s been around for at least two
    sessions, you can clear it.
-   Raise the bonus of one approach by one.

* * * * *

**RAISING APPROACH BONUSES**

When you raise the bonus of an approach, there’s only one rule you need to
remember: you can’t raise an approach bonus above Superb (+5).

* * * * *

### Major Milestones {#sigil_toc_id_53 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}

Major milestones should only occur when something happens in the campaign that
shakes it up a lot—the end of a big story arc, the final defeat of a main NPC
villain, or any other large-scale change that reverberates around your game
world.

These milestones are about gaining more power. The challenges of yesterday
simply aren’t sufficient to threaten these characters anymore, and the threats
of tomorrow will need to be more adept, organized, and determined to stand
against them.

Achieving a major milestone confers the benefits of a significant
milestone and a minor milestone. In addition, you may do all of the following:

Take an additional point of refresh, which you may immediately use to purchase
a stunt if you wish.

Rename your character’s high concept (optional).

Being the GM {#sigil_toc_id_54 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
============

The GM has many responsibilities, such as presenting the conflict to the
players, controlling NPCs, and helping everyone apply the rules to the
situation in the game.

Let’s talk about the GM’s jobs.

Help Build Campaigns {#sigil_toc_id_55 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
--------------------

A campaign is a series of games you play with the same characters, where the
story builds on what happened in earlier sessions. All the players should
collaborate with the GM to plan how the campaign will work. Usually this is a
conversation among all of you to decide what sort of heroes you want to play,
what sort of world you live in, and what sorts of bad guys you’ll have. Talk
about how serious you want the game to be and how long you want it to last.

* * * * *

-   Cat-people sky pirates in flying ships, always on the run from the Royal
    Navy trying to catch them.
-   Magic-wielding desert townsfolk stand against the invading soldiers of the
    evil Steel Empire.
-   Students at a boarding school for magical youth solve mysteries and uncover
    secrets of their ancient school.

**LEARNING HOW TO BE A GM**

Being a GM and running games can seem intimidating and difficult at first. It’s
a skill that takes some practice to master, so don’t worry—you’ll get better
the more you do it. If you’d like to read more about the art of GMing Fate,
there are several chapters in the Fate Core rules that you should check
out: Running the Game, Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios, and The Long Game are
particularly helpful. Fate Core is available for free
at [*www.evilhat.com*](http://www.evilhat.com).

* * * * *

\

Build Scenarios and Run Game Sessions {#sigil_toc_id_56 .Heading-2 .para-style-override-7 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
-------------------------------------

A scenario is one short story arc, the sort of thing you might see wrapped up
in one or two episodes of an adventure television show, even if it’s a smaller
part of a bigger story. Usually you can wrap up a scenario in one to three game
sessions, assuming you play for three or four hours at a time. But what is a
scenario, and how do you build one?

### Scenarios {#sigil_toc_id_57 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

A scenario needs two things: A bad guy with a goal, and a reason the PCs can’t
ignore it.

Bad guy with a goal: You’ve probably figured this out already. The campaign’s
main opposition, or one of his allies, is probably your bad guy.

Something the PCs can’t ignore: Now you have to give the PCs a reason to care.
Make sure the bad guy’s goal is up in the PCs’ faces, where they need to do
something about it or bad things will happen to them, or to people or things
they value.

### Running Game Sessions {#sigil_toc_id_58 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

Now that your bad guy is doing something the PCs will pay attention to, it’s
time to start them off. Sometimes the best way to do that, especially for the
first session of a new story arc, is to put them right in the action. Once the
PCs know why they should care about what’s going on, you just get out of the
way and let them take care of it.

That said, there are a bunch of tasks the GM needs to perform to run
the session:

-   Run scenes: A session is made up of individual scenes. Decide where the
    scene begins, who’s there, and what’s going on. Decide when all the
    interesting things have played out and the scene’s over.
-   Adjudicate the rules: When some question comes up about how to apply the
    rules, you get final say.
-   Set difficulties: You decide how [difficult
    tasks](#Setting-Difficulty-Levels) should be.
-   Play the NPCs: Each player controls their own character, but you control
    all the rest, including the bad guys.
-   Keep things moving: If the players don’t know what to do next, it’s your
    job to give them a nudge. Never let things get too bogged down in
    indecision or because they don’t have enough information—do something to
    shake things up.
-   Make sure everyone has a chance to be awesome: Your goal isn’t to defeat
    the players, but to challenge them. Make sure every PC gets a chance to be
    the star once in a while, from the big bad warrior to the little sneaky
    thief.

\

Setting Difficulty Levels {#sigil_toc_id_59 .Heading-2 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
-------------------------

\

When another character is opposing a PC, their rolls provide the opposition in
a conflict, contest, or challenge. But if there’s no active opposition, you
have to decide how hard the task is.

Low difficulties are best when you want to give the PCs a chance to show off
and be awesome.Difficulties near their approach ratings are best when you want
to provide tension but not overwhelm them. High difficulties are best when you
want to emphasize how dire or unusual the circumstances are and make them pull
out all the stops.

### Rules of Thumb: {#sigil_toc_id_60 .Heading-3 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}

-   If the task isn’t very tough at all, give it a Mediocre (+0)—or just tell
    the player they succeed without a roll.
-   If you can think of at least one reason why the task is tough, pick
    Fair (+2).
-   If the task is extremely difficult, pick Great (+4).
-   If the task is impossibly difficult, go as high as you think makes sense.
    The PC will need to drop some fate points and get lots of help to succeed,
    but that’s fine.

* * * * *

**OPTIONAL RULE: APPROACH-RELATED TARGET NUMBERS**

Sometimes being Careful makes things a lot easier; sometimes it just takes too
long. The GM may wish to adjust the target number up or down by 1 or 2
depending on whether you choose a fitting or a problematic approach. This makes
things a bit more complex, but for some groups it’s worth it.

* * * * *

Bad Guys {#sigil_toc_id_61 .Heading-2 .para-style-override-7 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px;"}
--------

When you make a bad guy, you can stat them out exactly like the PCs, with
approaches, aspects, stress, and consequences. You should do this for important
or recurring bad guys who are intended to give the PCs some real difficulties,
but you shouldn’t need more than one or two of these in a scenario.

Mooks: Other bad guys are mooks—unnamed thugs or monsters or goons that are
there to make the PCs’ day a little more difficult, but they’re designed to be
more or less easily swept aside, especially by powerful PCs. Here’s how you
create their stats:

1.  Make a list of what this mook is skilled at. They get a +2 to all rolls
    dealing with these things.
2.  Make a list of what this mook is bad at. They get a −2 to all rolls dealing
    with these things.
3.  Everything else gets a +0 when rolled.
4.  Give the mook an aspect or two to reinforce what they’re good and bad at,
    or if they have a particular strength or vulnerability. It’s okay if a
    mook’s aspects are really simple.
5.  Mooks have zero, one, or two boxes in their stress track, depending on how
    tough you imagine them to be.
6.  Mooks can’t take consequences. If they run out of stress boxes (or don’t
    have any), the next hit takes them down.

\

* * * * *

**CYCLOPS HOUSE BULLY**

Cyclops House Bully, Cowardly Without Backup

Skilled (+2) at: Frightening other students, weaseling out of trouble, breaking
things

Bad (-2) at: Planning, studying

Stress: None (first hit takes them out)

* * * * *

**STEEL ASSASSIN**

Steel Assassin, The Night Is Ours

Skilled (+2) at: Sneaking, ambushing

Bad (-2) at: Standing up to determined opposition

Stress: O

* * * * *

**SKY SHARK**

I’m a Shark, Vulnerable Belly

Skilled (+2) at: Flying, biting

Bad (-2) at: Anything that isn’t flying or biting

Stress: OO

* * * * *

\

Groups of Mooks: If you have a lot of low-level bad guys facing the PCs, you
can make your job easier by treating them as a group—or maybe a few groups.
Instead of tracking a dozen bad guys, you track three groups of four bad guys
each. Each of these groups acts like a single character and has a set of stats
just like a single mook would: 

1.  Choose a couple of things they’re skilled at. You might designate “ganging
    up” as one of the things the group is good at.
2.  Choose a couple of things they’re not so good at.
3.  Give them an aspect. 
4.  Give them one stress box for every two individuals in the group. 

* * * * *

GANG OF THUGS

Axe Handles & Crowbars

Skilled (+2) at: Ganging up, scaring innocent people

Bad (-2) at: Thinking ahead, fighting when outnumbered

Stress: **O** **O** (4 thugs)

* * * * *

Fate Core has a way of handling this, called mobs (see the “Creating the
Opposition” section of theRunning the Game chapter in Fate Core). Feel free to
use that option if you prefer. Note that it may lead to very strong mobs,
unless you start with extremely weak mooks—if you want to give your PCs a
serious challenge, that could be one way to do it.

Example Characters {#sigil_toc_id_62 .Heading-1 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"}
